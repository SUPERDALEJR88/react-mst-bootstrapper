# react-mst-bootstrapper

This script creates a react app, installs a mobx-state-tree and includes routing. It also includes separate views for mobile and desktop viewing, and lays out the app's file structure.


npm is required to use. Use something like Homebrew to insall if on Mac.



## Use
Simply copy the shell script and files folder to a directory of your choosing. Enter the command 

`sh react-mst-bootstrapper.sh`

The script will prompt you for name for your application - name it something meaningful. It can take a few minutes to run since it is installing multiple packages.  The app will be created in a new folder that's titled as the name you entered. To start the app, navigate to this new directory and enter the command

`npm start`

The app will start in your default browser.
